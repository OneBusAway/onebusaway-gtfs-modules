/**
 * Entity types that wish to support "extensions" should implement this type.
 *
 * <p>Extensions allow users of a CSV-entity-based library to add custom fields to an existing
 * entity type without modify the source of the base entity type. For example, consider a regular
 * entity type named person:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class Person implements HasExtensions {
 *   private int id;
 *   private String name;
 *   ...
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Now consider CSV data for such an entity with an additional custom field "age":
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * id,name,age
 * 1,Alice,27
 * 2,Bob,45
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Normally, to parse the age field, one would extend the <code>Person</code> entity. However, if
 * the entity type is being distributed as part of a pre-compiled library and the user wants to
 * extend it without modifying the base source code, they can use an extension type instead:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class PersonExtension {
 *   private int age;
 *   ...
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * The extension type can be registered with your {@link EntitySchemaFactory} to indicate that the
 * extension type should be used to process additional fields when reading or writing instances of
 * the base entity type.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * DefaultEntitySchemaFactory factory = new DefaultEntitySchemaFactory();
 * factory.addExtension(Person.class, PersonExtension.class);
 *
 * CsvEntityReader reader = new CsvEntityReader();
 * reader.setEntitySchemaFactory(factory);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Now when instances of <code>Person</code> are read, instances of <code>PersonExtension</code>
 * will be created and read for each <code>Person</code> as well. These extension instances can be
 * accessed via the methods of {@link HasExtensions}:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Person person = ...
 * PersonExtension extension = person.getExtension(PersonExtension.class);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * See {@link AbstractEntitySchemaFactoryImpl#addExtension(Class, Class)} for more details on
 * registering specific extension types.
