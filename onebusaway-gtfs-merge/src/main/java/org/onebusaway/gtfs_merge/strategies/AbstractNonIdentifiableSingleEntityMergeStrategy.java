/**
 * Non-identifiable entities include types like {@link Transfer}, {@link FareRule} and {@link
 * Frequency} entities. These entities do not have identifiers in the GTFS feed so they do not
 * duplicate other entities in the id-based sense. Instead, these entities more often define a rule
 * for how other entities might be interpreted. As such, determining if two non-identifiable
 * entities are duplicates can be a bit tricky. For now, we simply consider entities of this type to
 * be duplicates if they are exactly the same in two feeds. It's left as future work to implement
 * fuzzy duplicate detection for entities of this type.
