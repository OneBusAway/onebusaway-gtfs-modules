/**
 * Indicates that no default agency id (see {@link GtfsReaderContext#getDefaultAgencyId()} was
 * specified for a particular feed. Recall that {@link GtfsReader} will attempt to fill in the
 * {@link AgencyAndId#setAgencyId(String)} agencyId value for all entities loaded by the reader so
 * as to make entity ids unique across feeds. For entities such as {@link Route} and {@link Trip},
 * the agency id will be resolved automatically to any referenced {@link Agency} in the {@link
 * Route}. However, for all other entities, we need some agency id. By default, the {@link
 * Agency#getId()} of the first {@link Agency} loaded by the reader will be used. However, you may
 * also specify a default agency with a call to {@link GtfsReader#setDefaultAgencyId(String)}.
