/**
 * While the set of {@link ServiceCalendar} and {@link ServiceCalendarDate} entities for a given
 * GTFS feed compactly represent the dates of service for a particular service id, they are not
 * particularly amenable to quick calculations.
 *
 * <p>The {@link CalendarService} abstracts common date operations into a service interface. The
 * service is typically backed by an efficient data structure that has scanned all the {@link
 * ServiceCalendar} and {@link ServiceCalendarDate} entities into an appropriate representation.
 *
 * <p>Many of the methods in {@link CalendarService} refer to "service dates". A service date is a
 * particular date when a particular service id is active. The service date is represented by a
 * {@link ServiceDate} object, which is a locale-independent way of representing the year-month-date
 * for a particular service date.
 *
 * <p>A service date can be localized to a particular timezone (as specified for a particular {@link
 * Agency}) by calling the {@link ServiceDate#getAsDate(java.util.TimeZone)} method to return an
 * actual {@link Date} object. Typically, the date is specified as midnight at the start of the day
 * in the specified timezone for the specified service date, such that adding the arrival or
 * departure time in seconds (as specified in a {@link StopTime}) will return the actual arrival or
 * departure time in UTC. Note that on some days, like daylight saving time days, the time may not
 * actually be at midnight in order the make the {@link StopTime} calculation correct, per the GTFS
 * spec.
 *
 * <p>In many {@link CalendarService} methods, we refer to a {@link LocalizedServiceId}, which is a
 * service id that also includes timezone information, such that localized service dates can be
 * returned by a method. It's important to note that a single timezone can't be attached to a
 * particular service id, since agencies with potentially different timezones can refer to the same
 * service id in a given GTFS feed.

   * Given the specified localized service id, which has a corresponding set of localized service
   * dates, determine the sublist of service dates that, when extended with the specified {@link
   * ServiceInterval}, overlap with the specified from-to time range.
   *
   * <p>Let's consider a few concrete examples to describe what this method does.
   *
   * <p>Consider a single {@link StopTime} with an arrival and departure time. That StopTime is part
   * of a {@link Trip}, which means it has a service id attached to it. We wish to answer the
   * question, What service dates would make the specified StopTime active in a particular time
   * range? To answer that question, we'd need to consider each of the localized service dates for
   * which the specified service id is active, add the StopTime arrival and departure offset to
   * each, and see if the resulting time falls within the target range. This method can perform that
   * comparison. By specifying the target service id, a {@link ServiceInterval} whose min and max
   * arrival and departure times are set to the arrival and departure time of the {@link StopTime},
   * and the target from-to time interval, the method will return the set of localized service dates
   * that would make the StopTime arrival or departure times active in the specified target time
   * range.
   *
   * <p>As slightly different example, consider answering that same question for multiple {@link
   * StopTime} objects, such as all the StopTimes for a particular trip or all the StopTimes for a
   * particular stop. The question is the same, but the difference is now there are multiple arrival
   * and departure times. Here, an appropriate {@link ServiceInterval} can be constructed that
   * includes the min and max arrival and departure times for the set of {@link StopTime} objects
   * and the calculation will be done looking for service dates that cause any part of the service
   * interval to overlap with the target from-to range.
   *
   * <p>Note that this method considers both the arrival and departure times when looking for
   * overlaps. To consider only arrival times, check out {@link
   * #getServiceDateArrivalsWithinRange(LocalizedServiceId, ServiceInterval, Date, Date)} and for
   * departures, check out {@link #getServiceDateDeparturesWithinRange(LocalizedServiceId,
